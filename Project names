1. Use bio3d package to identify binding sites from pdb files

2. Use bio3d to give an output of residue names involved in the binding site

3. Select the residues from the identified binding site from a pdb file

4. Rewrite a column of pdb file (using Plevin code) to isolte those residues 

5. Get an output that represents the structure of the binding site found
